      <h2>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PCRE2 AND PERL</h2>

      <p>This document describes the differences in the ways that
      PCRE2 and Perl handle regular expressions. The differences
      described here are with respect to Perl versions 5.10 and
      above.</p>

      <p>1. PCRE2 has only a subset of Perl's Unicode support.
      Details of what it does have are given in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2unicode.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2unicode</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

      <p>2. PCRE2 allows repeat quantifiers only on parenthesized
      assertions, but they do not mean what you might think. For
      example, (?!a){3} does not assert that the next three
      characters are not "a". It just asserts that the next
      character is not "a" three times (in principle: PCRE2
      optimizes this to run the assertion just once). Perl allows
      repeat quantifiers on other assertions such as \b, but these
      do not seem to have any use.</p>

      <p>3. Capturing subpatterns that occur inside negative
      lookahead assertions are counted, but their entries in the
      offsets vector are never set. Perl sometimes (but not always)
      sets its numerical variables from inside negative
      assertions.</p>

      <p>4. The following Perl escape sequences are not supported:
      \l, \u, \L, \U, and \N when followed by a character name or
      Unicode value. (\N on its own, matching a non-newline
      character, is supported.) In fact these are implemented by
      Perl's general string-handling and are not part of its
      pattern matching engine. If any of these are encountered by
      PCRE2, an error is generated by default. However, if the
      PCRE2_ALT_BSUX option is set, \U and \u are interpreted as
      ECMAScript interprets them.</p>

      <p>5. The Perl escape sequences \p, \P, and \X are supported
      only if PCRE2 is built with Unicode support. The properties
      that can be tested with \p and \P are limited to the general
      category properties such as Lu and Nd, script names such as
      Greek or Han, and the derived properties Any and L&amp;.
      PCRE2 does support the Cs (surrogate) property, which Perl
      does not; the Perl documentation says "Because Perl hides the
      need for the user to understand the internal representation
      of Unicode characters, there is no need to implement the
      somewhat messy concept of surrogates."</p>

      <p>6. PCRE2 does support the \Q...\E escape for quoting
      substrings. Characters in between are treated as literals.
      This is slightly different from Perl in that $ and @ are also
      handled as literals inside the quotes. In Perl, they cause
      variable interpolation (but of course PCRE2 does not have
      variables). Note the following examples:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
Pattern            PCRE2 matches      Perl matches
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   \Qabc$xyz\E        abc$xyz           abc followed by the
                                          contents of $xyz
   \Qabc\$xyz\E       abc\$xyz          abc\$xyz
   \Qabc\E\$\Qxyz\E   abc$xyz           abc$xyz
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The \Q...\E sequence is recognized both inside and outside
      character classes.</p>

      <p>7. Fairly obviously, PCRE2 does not support the (?{code})
      and (??{code}) constructions. However, there is support for
      recursive patterns. This is not available in Perl 5.8, but it
      is in Perl 5.10. Also, the PCRE2 "callout" feature allows an
      external function to be called during pattern matching. See
      the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2callout.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2callout</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation for details.</p>

      <p>8. Subpatterns that are called as subroutines (whether or
      not recursively) are always treated as atomic groups in
      PCRE2. This is like Python, but unlike Perl. Captured values
      that are set outside a subroutine call can be reference from
      inside in PCRE2, but not in Perl. There is a discussion that
      explains these differences in more detail in the section on
      recursion differences from Perl in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

      <p>9. If any of the backtracking control verbs are used in a
      subpattern that is called as a subroutine (whether or not
      recursively), their effect is confined to that subpattern; it
      does not extend to the surrounding pattern. This is not
      always the case in Perl. In particular, if (*THEN) is present
      in a group that is called as a subroutine, its action is
      limited to that group, even if the group does not contain any
      | characters. Note that such subpatterns are processed as
      anchored at the point where they are tested.</p>

      <p>10. If a pattern contains more than one backtracking
      control verb, the first one that is backtracked onto acts.
      For example, in the pattern A(*COMMIT)B(*PRUNE)C a failure in
      B triggers (*COMMIT), but a failure in C triggers (*PRUNE).
      Perl's behaviour is more complex; in many cases it is the
      same as PCRE2, but there are examples where it differs.</p>

      <p>11. Most backtracking verbs in assertions have their
      normal actions. They are not confined to the assertion.</p>

      <p>12. There are some differences that are concerned with the
      settings of captured strings when part of a pattern is
      repeated. For example, matching "aba" against the pattern
      /^(a(b)?)+$/ in Perl leaves $2 unset, but in PCRE2 it is set
      to "b".</p>

      <p>13. PCRE2's handling of duplicate subpattern numbers and
      duplicate subpattern names is not as general as Perl's. This
      is a consequence of the fact the PCRE2 works internally just
      with numbers, using an external table to translate between
      numbers and names. In particular, a pattern such as
      (?|(?&lt;a&gt;A)|(?&lt;b)B), where the two capturing
      parentheses have the same number but different names, is not
      supported, and causes an error at compile time. If it were
      allowed, it would not be possible to distinguish which
      parentheses matched, because both names map to capturing
      subpattern number 1. To avoid this confusing situation, an
      error is given at compile time.</p>

      <p>14. Perl recognizes comments in some places that PCRE2
      does not, for example, between the ( and ? at the start of a
      subpattern. If the /x modifier is set, Perl allows white
      space between ( and ? (though current Perls warn that this is
      deprecated) but PCRE2 never does, even if the PCRE2_EXTENDED
      option is set.</p>

      <p>15. Perl, when in warning mode, gives warnings for
      character classes such as [A-\d] or [a-[:digit:]]. It then
      treats the hyphens as literals. PCRE2 has no warning
      features, so it gives an error in these cases because they
      are almost certainly user mistakes.</p>

      <p>16. In PCRE2, the upper/lower case character properties Lu
      and Ll are not affected when case-independent matching is
      specified. For example, \p{Lu} always matches an upper case
      letter. I think Perl has changed in this respect; in the
      release at the time of writing (5.16), \p{Lu} and \p{Ll}
      match all letters, regardless of case, when case independence
      is specified.</p>

      <p>17. PCRE2 provides some extensions to the Perl regular
      expression facilities. Perl 5.10 includes new features that
      are not in earlier versions of Perl, some of which (such as
      named parentheses) have been in PCRE2 for some time. This
      list is with respect to Perl 5.10:</p>

      <p>(a) Although lookbehind assertions in PCRE2 must match
      fixed length strings, each alternative branch of a lookbehind
      assertion can match a different length of string. Perl
      requires them all to have the same length.</p>

      <p>(b) If PCRE2_DOLLAR_ENDONLY is set and PCRE2_MULTILINE is
      not set, the $ meta-character matches only at the very end of
      the string.</p>

      <p>(c) A backslash followed by a letter with no special
      meaning is faulted. (Perl can be made to issue a
      warning.)</p>

      <p>(d) If PCRE2_UNGREEDY is set, the greediness of the
      repetition quantifiers is inverted, that is, by default they
      are not greedy, but if followed by a question mark they
      are.</p>

      <p>(e) PCRE2_ANCHORED can be used at matching time to force a
      pattern to be tried only at the first matching position in
      the subject string.</p>

      <p>(f) The PCRE2_NOTBOL, PCRE2_NOTEOL, PCRE2_NOTEMPTY,
      PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART, and PCRE2_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE options
      have no Perl equivalents.</p>

      <p>(g) The \R escape sequence can be restricted to match only
      CR, LF, or CRLF by the PCRE2_BSR_ANYCRLF option.</p>

      <p>(h) The callout facility is PCRE2-specific.</p>

      <p>(i) The partial matching facility is PCRE2-specific.</p>

      <p>(j) The alternative matching function (<code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() matches in a different
      way and is not Perl-compatible.</p>

      <p>(k) PCRE2 recognizes some special sequences such as (*CR)
      at the start of a pattern that set overall options that
      cannot be changed within the pattern.</p>
