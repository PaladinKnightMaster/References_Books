      <h2>PARTIAL MATCHING IN PCRE2</h2>

      <p>In normal use of PCRE2, if the subject string that is
      passed to a matching function matches as far as it goes, but
      is too short to match the entire pattern, PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH
      is returned. There are circumstances where it might be
      helpful to distinguish this case from other cases in which
      there is no match.</p>

      <p>Consider, for example, an application where a human is
      required to type in data for a field with specific formatting
      requirements. An example might be a date in the form
      <code class="function">ddmmmyy</code>, defined by this
      pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the application sees the user's keystrokes one by one,
      and can check that what has been typed so far is potentially
      valid, it is able to raise an error as soon as a mistake is
      made, by beeping and not reflecting the character that has
      been typed, for example. This immediate feedback is likely to
      be a better user interface than a check that is delayed until
      the entire string has been entered. Partial matching can also
      be useful when the subject string is very long and is not all
      available at once.</p>

      <p>PCRE2 supports partial matching by means of the
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT and PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD options, which can
      be set when calling a matching function. The difference
      between the two options is whether or not a partial match is
      preferred to an alternative complete match, though the
      details differ between the two types of matching function. If
      both options are set, PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD takes
      precedence.</p>

      <p>If you want to use partial matching with just-in-time
      optimized code, you must call <code class="function">pcre2_jit_compile</code>() with one or both of
      these options:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT
 PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE should also be set if you are going to
      run non-partial matches on the same pattern. If the
      appropriate JIT mode has not been compiled, interpretive
      matching code is used.</p>

      <p>Setting a partial matching option disables two of PCRE2's
      standard optimizations. PCRE2 remembers the last literal code
      unit in a pattern, and abandons matching immediately if it is
      not present in the subject string. This optimization cannot
      be used for a subject string that might match only partially.
      PCRE2 also knows the minimum length of a matching string, and
      does not bother to run the matching function on shorter
      strings. This optimization is also disabled for partial
      matching.</p>

      <h2>PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre2_match()</h2>

      <p>A partial match occurs during a call to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() when the end of the subject
      string is reached successfully, but matching cannot continue
      because more characters are needed. However, at least one
      character in the subject must have been inspected. This
      character need not form part of the final matched string;
      lookbehind assertions and the \K escape sequence provide ways
      of inspecting characters before the start of a matched
      string. The requirement for inspecting at least one character
      exists because an empty string can always be matched; without
      such a restriction there would always be a partial match of
      an empty string at the end of the subject.</p>

      <p>When a partial match is returned, the first two elements
      in the ovector point to the portion of the subject that was
      matched, but the values in the rest of the ovector are
      undefined. The appearance of \K in the pattern has no effect
      for a partial match. Consider this pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/abc\K123/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If it is matched against "456abc123xyz" the result is a
      complete match, and the ovector defines the matched string as
      "123", because \K resets the "start of match" point. However,
      if a partial match is requested and the subject string is
      "456abc12", a partial match is found for the string "abc12",
      because all these characters are needed for a subsequent
      re-match with additional characters.</p>

      <p>What happens when a partial match is identified depends on
      which of the two partial matching options are set.</p>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2partial-3_sect3" name="pcre2partial-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT WITH pcre2_match()</h3>

        <p>If PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is set when <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() identifies a partial match,
        the partial match is remembered, but matching continues as
        normal, and other alternatives in the pattern are tried. If
        no complete match can be found, PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is
        returned instead of PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH.</p>

        <p>This option is "soft" because it prefers a complete
        match over a partial match. All the various matching items
        in a pattern behave as if the subject string is potentially
        complete. For example, \z, \Z, and $ match at the end of
        the subject, as normal, and for \b and \B the end of the
        subject is treated as a non-alphanumeric.</p>

        <p>If there is more than one partial match, the first one
        that was found provides the data that is returned. Consider
        this pattern:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/123\w+X|dogY/
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If this is matched against the subject string
        "abc123dog", both alternatives fail to match, but the end
        of the subject is reached during matching, so
        PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned. The offsets are set to 3
        and 9, identifying "123dog" as the first partial match that
        was found. (In this example, there are two partial matches,
        because "dog" on its own partially matches the second
        alternative.)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2partial-3_sect4" name="pcre2partial-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD WITH pcre2_match()</h3>

        <p>If PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set for <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is
        returned as soon as a partial match is found, without
        continuing to search for possible complete matches. This
        option is "hard" because it prefers an earlier partial
        match over a later complete match. For this reason, the
        assumption is made that the end of the supplied subject
        string may not be the true end of the available data, and
        so, if \z, \Z, \b, \B, or $ are encountered at the end of
        the subject, the result is PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL, provided
        that at least one character in the subject has been
        inspected.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2partial-3_sect5" name="pcre2partial-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Comparing hard and soft partial matching</h3>

        <p>The difference between the two partial matching options
        can be illustrated by a pattern such as:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)?/
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This matches either "dog" or "dogsbody", greedily (that
        is, it prefers the longer string if possible). If it is
        matched against the string "dog" with PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT,
        it yields a complete match for "dog". However, if
        PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, the result is
        PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL. On the other hand, if the pattern is
        made ungreedy the result is different:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)??/
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>In this case the result is always a complete match
        because that is found first, and matching never continues
        after finding a complete match. It might be easier to
        follow this explanation by thinking of the two patterns
        like this:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 /dog(sbody)?/    is the same as  /dogsbody|dog/
 /dog(sbody)??/   is the same as  /dog|dogsbody/
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The second pattern will never match "dogsbody", because
        it will always find the shorter match first.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2partial-3_sect6" name="pcre2partial-3_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre2_dfa_match()</h2>

      <p>The DFA functions move along the subject string character
      by character, without backtracking, searching for all
      possible matches simultaneously. If the end of the subject is
      reached before the end of the pattern, there is the
      possibility of a partial match, again provided that at least
      one character has been inspected.</p>

      <p>When PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is set, PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is
      returned only if there have been no complete matches.
      Otherwise, the complete matches are returned. However, if
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, a partial match takes precedence
      over any complete matches. The portion of the string that was
      matched when the longest partial match was found is set as
      the first matching string.</p>

      <p>Because the DFA functions always search for all possible
      matches, and there is no difference between greedy and
      ungreedy repetition, their behaviour is different from the
      standard functions when PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set. Consider
      the string "dog" matched against the ungreedy pattern shown
      above:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)??/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Whereas the standard function stops as soon as it finds
      the complete match for "dog", the DFA function also finds the
      partial match for "dogsbody", and so returns that when
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2partial-3_sect7" name="pcre2partial-3_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>PARTIAL MATCHING AND WORD BOUNDARIES</h2>

      <p>If a pattern ends with one of sequences \b or \B, which
      test for word boundaries, partial matching with
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT can give counter-intuitive results.
      Consider this pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/\bcat\b/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This matches "cat", provided there is a word boundary at
      either end. If the subject string is "the cat", the
      comparison of the final "t" with a following character cannot
      take place, so a partial match is found. However, normal
      matching carries on, and \b matches at the end of the subject
      when the last character is a letter, so a complete match is
      found. The result, therefore, is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL. Using
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD in this case does yield
      PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL, because then the partial match takes
      precedence.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>EXAMPLE OF PARTIAL MATCHING USING PCRE2TEST</h2>

      <p>If the <code class="function">partial_soft</code> (or
      <code class="function">ps</code>) modifier is present on a
      <code class="function">pcre2test</code> data line, the
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT option is used for the match. Here is a
      run of <code class="function">pcre2test</code> that uses the
      date example quoted above:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
 data&gt; 25jun04\=ps
  0: 25jun04
  1: jun
 data&gt; 25dec3\=ps
 Partial match: 23dec3
 data&gt; 3ju\=ps
 Partial match: 3ju
 data&gt; 3juj\=ps
 No match
 data&gt; j\=ps
 No match
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The first data string is matched completely, so
      <code class="function">pcre2test</code> shows the matched
      substrings. The remaining four strings do not match the
      complete pattern, but the first two are partial matches.
      Similar output is obtained if DFA matching is used.</p>

      <p>If the <code class="function">partial_hard</code> (or
      <code class="function">ph</code>) modifier is present on a
      <code class="function">pcre2test</code> data line, the
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD option is set for the match.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">

      <h2>MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre2_dfa_match()</h2>

      <p>When a partial match has been found using a DFA matching
      function, it is possible to continue the match by providing
      additional subject data and calling the function again with
      the same compiled regular expression, this time setting the
      PCRE2_DFA_RESTART option. You must pass the same working
      space as before, because this is where details of the
      previous partial match are stored. Here is an example using
      <code class="function">pcre2test</code>:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
 data&gt; 23ja\=dfa,ps
 Partial match: 23ja
 data&gt; n05\=dfa,dfa_restart
  0: n05
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The first call has "23ja" as the subject, and requests
      partial matching; the second call has "n05" as the subject
      for the continued (restarted) match. Notice that when the
      match is complete, only the last part is shown; PCRE2 does
      not retain the previously partially-matched string. It is up
      to the calling program to do that if it needs to.</p>

      <p>That means that, for an unanchored pattern, if a continued
      match fails, it is not possible to try again at a new
      starting point. All this facility is capable of doing is
      continuing with the previous match attempt. In the previous
      example, if the second set of data is "ug23" the result is no
      match, even though there would be a match for "aug23" if the
      entire string were given at once. Depending on the
      application, this may or may not be what you want. The only
      way to allow for starting again at the next character is to
      retain the matched part of the subject and try a new complete
      match.</p>

      <p>You can set the PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT or PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD
      options with PCRE2_DFA_RESTART to continue partial matching
      over multiple segments. This facility can be used to pass
      very long subject strings to the DFA matching functions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2partial-3_sect10" name="pcre2partial-3_sect10" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre2_match()</h2>

      <p>Unlike the DFA function, it is not possible to restart the
      previous match with a new segment of data when using
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(). Instead, new
      data must be added to the previous subject string, and the
      entire match re-run, starting from the point where the
      partial match occurred. Earlier data can be discarded.</p>

      <p>It is best to use PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD in this situation,
      because it does not treat the end of a segment as the end of
      the subject when matching \z, \Z, \b, \B, and $. Consider an
      unanchored pattern that matches dates:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d/
 data&gt; The date is 23ja\=ph
 Partial match: 23ja
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>At this stage, an application could discard the text
      preceding "23ja", add on text from the next segment, and call
      the matching function again. Unlike the DFA matching
      function, the entire matching string must always be
      available, and the complete matching process occurs for each
      call, so more memory and more processing time is needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2partial-3_sect11" name="pcre2partial-3_sect11" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>ISSUES WITH MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING</h2>

      <p>Certain types of pattern may give problems with
      multi-segment matching, whichever matching function is
      used.</p>

      <p>1. If the pattern contains a test for the beginning of a
      line, you need to pass the PCRE2_NOTBOL option when the
      subject string for any call does start at the beginning of a
      line. There is also a PCRE2_NOTEOL option, but in practice
      when doing multi-segment matching you should be using
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD, which includes the effect of
      PCRE2_NOTEOL.</p>

      <p>2. If a pattern contains a lookbehind assertion,
      characters that precede the start of the partial match may
      have been inspected during the matching process. When using
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), sufficient
      characters must be retained for the next match attempt. You
      can ensure that enough characters are retained by doing the
      following:</p>

      <p>Before doing any matching, find the length of the longest
      lookbehind in the pattern by calling <code class="function">pcre2_pattern_info</code>() with the
      PCRE2_INFO_MAXLOOKBEHIND option. Note that the resulting
      count is in characters, not code units. After a partial
      match, moving back from the ovector[0] offset in the subject
      by the number of characters given for the maximum lookbehind
      gets you to the earliest character that must be retained. In
      a non-UTF or a 32-bit situation, moving back is just a
      subtraction, but in UTF-8 or UTF-16 you have to count
      characters while moving back through the code units.</p>

      <p>Characters before the point you have now reached can be
      discarded, and after the next segment has been added to what
      is retained, you should run the next match with the
      <code class="function">startoffset</code> argument set so
      that the match begins at the same point as before.</p>

      <p>For example, if the pattern "(?&lt;=123)abc" is partially
      matched against the string "xx123ab", the ovector offsets are
      5 and 7 ("ab"). The maximum lookbehind count is 3, so all
      characters before offset 2 can be discarded. The value of
      <code class="function">startoffset</code> for the next match
      should be 3. When <code class="function">pcre2test</code>
      displays a partial match, it indicates the lookbehind
      characters with '&lt;' characters:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; "(?&lt;=123)abc"
 data&gt; xx123ab\=ph
 Partial match: 123ab
                &lt;&lt;&lt;
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>3. Because a partial match must always contain at least
      one character, what might be considered a partial match of an
      empty string actually gives a "no match" result. For
      example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /c(?&lt;=abc)x/
 data&gt; ab\=ps
 No match
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the next segment begins "cx", a match should be found,
      but this will only happen if characters from the previous
      segment are retained. For this reason, a "no match" result
      should be interpreted as "partial match of an empty string"
      when the pattern contains lookbehinds.</p>

      <p>4. Matching a subject string that is split into multiple
      segments may not always produce exactly the same result as
      matching over one single long string, especially when
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is used. The section "Partial Matching and
      Word Boundaries" above describes an issue that arises if the
      pattern ends with \b or \B. Another kind of difference may
      occur when there are multiple matching possibilities, because
      (for PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT) a partial match result is given only
      when there are no completed matches. This means that as soon
      as the shortest match has been found, continuation to a new
      subject segment is no longer possible. Consider this
      <code class="function">pcre2test</code> example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /dog(sbody)?/
 data&gt; dogsb\=ps
  0: dog
 data&gt; do\=ps,dfa
 Partial match: do
 data&gt; gsb\=ps,dfa,dfa_restart
  0: g
 data&gt; dogsbody\=dfa
  0: dogsbody
  1: dog
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The first data line passes the string "dogsb" to a
      standard matching function, setting the PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT
      option. Although the string is a partial match for
      "dogsbody", the result is not PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL, because
      the shorter string "dog" is a complete match. Similarly, when
      the subject is presented to a DFA matching function in
      several parts ("do" and "gsb" being the first two) the match
      stops when "dog" has been found, and it is not possible to
      continue. On the other hand, if "dogsbody" is presented as a
      single string, a DFA matching function finds both
      matches.</p>

      <p>Because of these problems, it is best to use
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD when matching multi-segment data. The
      example above then behaves differently:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /dog(sbody)?/
 data&gt; dogsb\=ph
 Partial match: dogsb
 data&gt; do\=ps,dfa
 Partial match: do
 data&gt; gsb\=ph,dfa,dfa_restart
 Partial match: gsb
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>5. Patterns that contain alternatives at the top level
      which do not all start with the same pattern item may not
      work as expected when PCRE2_DFA_RESTART is used. For example,
      consider this pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
1234|3789
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the first part of the subject is "ABC123", a partial
      match of the first alternative is found at offset 3. There is
      no partial match for the second alternative, because such a
      match does not start at the same point in the subject string.
      Attempting to continue with the string "7890" does not yield
      a match because only those alternatives that match at one
      point in the subject are remembered. The problem arises
      because the start of the second alternative matches within
      the first alternative. There is no problem with anchored
      patterns or patterns such as:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
1234|ABCD
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>where no string can be a partial match for both
      alternatives. This is not a problem if a standard matching
      function is used, because the entire match has to be rerun
      each time:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /1234|3789/
 data&gt; ABC123\=ph
 Partial match: 123
 data&gt; 1237890
  0: 3789
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Of course, instead of using PCRE2_DFA_RESTART, the same
      technique of re-running the entire match can also be used
      with the DFA matching function. Another possibility is to
      work with two buffers. If a partial match at offset
      <code class="literal">n</code> in the first buffer is
      followed by "no match" when PCRE2_DFA_RESTART is used on the
      second buffer, you can then try a new match starting at
      offset <em class="replaceable"><code>n+1</code></em> in the
      first buffer.</p>
