      <h2>BUILDING PCRE2</h2>

      <p>PCRE2 is distributed with a <code class="function">configure</code> script that can be used to build
      the library in Unix-like environments using the applications
      known as Autotools. Also in the distribution are files to
      support building using <code class="function">CMake</code>
      instead of <code class="function">configure</code>. The text
      file <code class="constant">README</code> contains general
      information about building with Autotools (some of which is
      repeated below), and also has some comments about building on
      various operating systems. There is a lot more information
      about building PCRE2 without using Autotools (including
      information about using <code class="function">CMake</code>
      and building "by hand") in the text file called <em class="replaceable"><code>NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD</code></em>. You
      should consult this file as well as the <code class="constant">README</code> file if you are building in a
      non-Unix-like environment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">

      <h2>PCRE2 BUILD-TIME OPTIONS</h2>

      <p>The rest of this document describes the optional features
      of PCRE2 that can be selected when the library is compiled.
      It assumes use of the <code class="function">configure</code>
      script, where the optional features are selected or
      deselected by providing options to <code class="function">configure</code> before running the <code class="function">make</code> command. However, the same options can
      be selected in both Unix-like and non-Unix-like environments
      if you are using <code class="function">CMake</code> instead
      of <code class="function">configure</code> to build
      PCRE2.</p>

      <p>If you are not using Autotools or <code class="function">CMake</code>, option selection can be done by
      editing the <code class="filename">config.h</code> file, or
      by passing parameter settings to the compiler, as described
      in <em class="replaceable"><code>NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD</code></em>.</p>

      <p>The complete list of options for <code class="function">configure</code> (which includes the standard ones
      such as the selection of the installation directory) can be
      obtained by running</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
./configure --help
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The following sections include descriptions of options
      whose names begin with --enable or --disable. These settings
      specify changes to the defaults for the <code class="function">configure</code> command. Because of the way that
      <code class="function">configure</code> works, --enable and
      --disable always come in pairs, so the complementary option
      always exists as well, but as it specifies the default, it is
      not described.</p>

      <h2>BUILDING 8-BIT, 16-BIT AND 32-BIT LIBRARIES</h2>

      <p>By default, a library called <em class="replaceable"><code>libpcre2-8</code></em> is built,
      containing functions that take string arguments contained in
      vectors of bytes, interpreted either as single-byte
      characters, or UTF-8 strings. You can also build two other
      libraries, called <em class="replaceable"><code>libpcre2-16</code></em> and <em class="replaceable"><code>libpcre2-32</code></em>, which process
      strings that are contained in vectors of 16-bit and 32-bit
      code units, respectively. These can be interpreted either as
      single-unit characters or UTF-16/UTF-32 strings. To build
      these additional libraries, add one or both of the following
      to the <code class="function">configure</code> command:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 --enable-pcre2-16
 --enable-pcre2-32
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If you do not want the 8-bit library, add</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--disable-pcre2-8
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>as well. At least one of the three libraries must be
      built. Note that the POSIX wrapper is for the 8-bit library
      only, and that <code class="function">pcre2grep</code> is an
      8-bit program. Neither of these are built if you select only
      the 16-bit or 32-bit libraries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect4" name="pcre2build-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>BUILDING SHARED AND STATIC LIBRARIES</h2>

      <p>The Autotools PCRE2 building process uses <code class="function">libtool</code> to build both shared and static
      libraries by default. You can suppress an unwanted library by
      adding one of</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 --disable-shared
 --disable-static
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code>
      command.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect5" name="pcre2build-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>UNICODE AND UTF SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>By default, PCRE2 is built with support for Unicode and
      UTF character strings. To build it without Unicode support,
      add</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--disable-unicode
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      This setting applies to all three libraries. It is not
      possible to build one library with Unicode support, and
      another without, in the same configuration.</p>

      <p>Of itself, Unicode support does not make PCRE2 treat
      strings as UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32. To do that, applications
      that use the library have to set the PCRE2_UTF option when
      they call <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() to
      compile a pattern.</p>

      <p>UTF support allows the libraries to process character code
      points up to 0x10ffff in the strings that they handle. It
      also provides support for accessing the Unicode properties of
      such characters, using pattern escapes such as \P, \p, and
      \X. Only the general category properties such as <code class="function">Lu</code> and <code class="function">Nd</code> are
      supported. Details are given in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect6" name="pcre2build-3_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>Just-in-time compiler support is included in the build by
      specifying</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-jit
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This support is available only for certain hardware
      architectures. If this option is set for an unsupported
      architecture, a building error occurs. See the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2jit.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2jit</span>(3)</span></a> documentation
      for a discussion of JIT usage. When JIT support is enabled,
      pcre2grep automatically makes use of it, unless you add</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--disable-pcre2grep-jit
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the "configure" command.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect7" name="pcre2build-3_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>NEWLINE RECOGNITION</h2>

      <p>By default, PCRE2 interprets the linefeed (LF) character
      as indicating the end of a line. This is the normal newline
      character on Unix-like systems. You can compile PCRE2 to use
      carriage return (CR) instead, by adding</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-newline-is-cr
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      There is also an --enable-newline-is-lf option, which
      explicitly specifies linefeed as the newline character.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can specify that line endings are to be
      indicated by the two-character sequence CRLF (CR immediately
      followed by LF). If you want this, add</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-newline-is-crlf
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      There is a fourth option, specified by</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-newline-is-anycrlf
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>which causes PCRE2 to recognize any of the three sequences
      CR, LF, or CRLF as indicating a line ending. Finally, a fifth
      option, specified by</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-newline-is-any
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>causes PCRE2 to recognize any Unicode newline sequence.
      The Unicode newline sequences are the three just mentioned,
      plus the single characters VT (vertical tab, U+000B), FF
      (form feed, U+000C), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line
      separator, U+2028), and PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).</p>

      <p>Whatever default line ending convention is selected when
      PCRE2 is built can be overridden by applications that use the
      library. At build time it is conventional to use the standard
      for your operating system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect8" name="pcre2build-3_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>WHAT \R MATCHES</h2>

      <p>By default, the sequence \R in a pattern matches any
      Unicode newline sequence, independently of what has been
      selected as the line ending sequence. If you specify</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-bsr-anycrlf
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>the default is changed so that \R matches only CR, LF, or
      CRLF. Whatever is selected when PCRE2 is built can be
      overridden by applications that use the called.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect9" name="pcre2build-3_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>HANDLING VERY LARGE PATTERNS</h2>

      <p>Within a compiled pattern, offset values are used to point
      from one part to another (for example, from an opening
      parenthesis to an alternation metacharacter). By default, in
      the 8-bit and 16-bit libraries, two-byte values are used for
      these offsets, leading to a maximum size for a compiled
      pattern of around 64K code units. This is sufficient to
      handle all but the most gigantic patterns. Nevertheless, some
      people do want to process truly enormous patterns, so it is
      possible to compile PCRE2 to use three-byte or four-byte
      offsets by adding a setting such as</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--with-link-size=3
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      The value given must be 2, 3, or 4. For the 16-bit library, a
      value of 3 is rounded up to 4. In these libraries, using
      longer offsets slows down the operation of PCRE2 because it
      has to load additional data when handling them. For the
      32-bit library the value is always 4 and cannot be
      overridden; the value of --with-link-size is ignored.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect10" name="pcre2build-3_sect10" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>AVOIDING EXCESSIVE STACK USAGE</h2>

      <p>When matching with the <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() function, PCRE2 implements
      backtracking by making recursive calls to an internal
      function called <code class="function">match</code>(). In
      environments where the size of the stack is limited, this can
      severely limit PCRE2's operation. (The Unix environment does
      not usually suffer from this problem, but it may sometimes be
      necessary to increase the maximum stack size. There is a
      discussion in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2stack.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2stack</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation.) An alternative approach to recursion that
      uses memory from the heap to remember data, instead of using
      recursive function calls, has been implemented to work round
      the problem of limited stack size. If you want to build a
      version of PCRE2 that works this way, add</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--disable-stack-for-recursion
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command. By
      default, the system functions <code class="function">malloc</code>() and <code class="function">free</code>() are called to manage the heap memory
      that is required, but custom memory management functions can
      be called instead. PCRE2 runs noticeably more slowly when
      built in this way. This option affects only the <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() function; it is not relevant
      for <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>().</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect11" name="pcre2build-3_sect11" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>LIMITING PCRE2 RESOURCE USAGE</h2>

      <p>Internally, PCRE2 has a function called <code class="function">match</code>(), which it calls repeatedly
      (sometimes recursively) when matching a pattern with the
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() function. By
      controlling the maximum number of times this function may be
      called during a single matching operation, a limit can be
      placed on the resources used by a single call to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(). The limit can be changed at
      run time, as described in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a> documentation.
      The default is 10 million, but this can be changed by adding
      a setting such as</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--with-match-limit=500000
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      This setting has no effect on the <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() matching function.</p>

      <p>In some environments it is desirable to limit the depth of
      recursive calls of <code class="function">match</code>() more
      strictly than the total number of calls, in order to restrict
      the maximum amount of stack (or heap, if
      --disable-stack-for-recursion is specified) that is used. A
      second limit controls this; it defaults to the value that is
      set for --with-match-limit, which imposes no additional
      constraints. However, you can set a lower limit by adding,
      for example,</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--with-match-limit-recursion=10000
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      This value can also be overridden at run time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect12" name="pcre2build-3_sect12" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>CREATING CHARACTER TABLES AT BUILD TIME</h2>

      <p>PCRE2 uses fixed tables for processing characters whose
      code points are less than 256. By default, PCRE2 is built
      with a set of tables that are distributed in the file
      <em class="replaceable"><code>src/pcre2_chartables.c.dist</code></em>.
      These tables are for ASCII codes only. If you add</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-rebuild-chartables
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command,
      the distributed tables are no longer used. Instead, a program
      called <code class="function">dftables</code> is compiled and
      run. This outputs the source for new set of tables, created
      in the default locale of your C run-time system. (This method
      of replacing the tables does not work if you are cross
      compiling, because <code class="function">dftables</code> is
      run on the local host. If you need to create alternative
      tables when cross compiling, you will have to do so "by
      hand".)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect13" name="pcre2build-3_sect13" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>USING EBCDIC CODE</h2>

      <p>PCRE2 assumes by default that it will run in an
      environment where the character code is ASCII or Unicode,
      which is a superset of ASCII. This is the case for most
      computer operating systems. PCRE2 can, however, be compiled
      to run in an 8-bit EBCDIC environment by adding</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-ebcdic --disable-unicode
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      This setting implies --enable-rebuild-chartables. You should
      only use it if you know that you are in an EBCDIC environment
      (for example, an IBM mainframe operating system).</p>

      <p>It is not possible to support both EBCDIC and UTF-8 codes
      in the same version of the library. Consequently,
      --enable-unicode and --enable-ebcdic are mutually
      exclusive.</p>

      <p>The EBCDIC character that corresponds to an ASCII LF is
      assumed to have the value 0x15 by default. However, in some
      EBCDIC environments, 0x25 is used. In such an environment you
      should use</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-ebcdic-nl25
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>as well as, or instead of, --enable-ebcdic. The EBCDIC
      character for CR has the same value as in ASCII, namely,
      0x0d. Whichever of 0x15 and 0x25 is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> chosen as LF is made to
      correspond to the Unicode NEL character (which, in Unicode,
      is 0x85).</p>

      <p>The options that select newline behaviour, such as
      --enable-newline-is-cr, and equivalent run-time options,
      refer to these character values in an EBCDIC environment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect14" name="pcre2build-3_sect14" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>PCRE2GREP OPTIONS FOR COMPRESSED FILE SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>By default, <code class="function">pcre2grep</code> reads
      all files as plain text. You can build it so that it
      recognizes files whose names end in <em class="replaceable"><code>.gz</code></em> or <em class="replaceable"><code>.bz2</code></em>, and reads them with
      <code class="function">libz</code> or <code class="function">libbz2</code>, respectively, by adding one or both
      of</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 --enable-pcre2grep-libz
 --enable-pcre2grep-libbz2
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      These options naturally require that the relevant libraries
      are installed on your system. Configuration will fail if they
      are not.</p>

      <h2>PCRE2GREP BUFFER SIZE</h2>

      <p><code class="function">pcre2grep</code> uses an internal
      buffer to hold a "window" on the file it is scanning, in
      order to be able to output "before" and "after" lines when it
      finds a match. The size of the buffer is controlled by a
      parameter whose default value is 20K. The buffer itself is
      three times this size, but because of the way it is used for
      holding "before" lines, the longest line that is guaranteed
      to be processable is the parameter size. You can change the
      default parameter value by adding, for example,</p>

      <h2>PCRE2TEST OPTION FOR LIBREADLINE SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>If you add one of</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 --enable-pcre2test-libreadline
 --enable-pcre2test-libedit
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command,
      <code class="function">pcre2test</code> is linked with the
      <code class="function">libreadline</code> or<code class="function">libedit</code> library, respectively, and when its
      input is from a terminal, it reads it using the <code class="function">readline</code>() function. This provides
      line-editing and history facilities. Note that <code class="function">libreadline</code> is GPL-licensed, so if you
      distribute a binary of <code class="function">pcre2test</code> linked in this way, there may be
      licensing issues. These can be avoided by linking instead
      with <code class="function">libedit</code>, which has a BSD
      licence.</p>

      <p>Setting --enable-pcre2test-libreadline causes the
      <code class="option">−lreadline</code> option to be
      added to the <code class="function">pcre2test</code> build.
      In many operating environments with a sytem-installed
      readline library this is sufficient. However, in some
      environments (e.g. if an unmodified distribution version of
      readline is in use), some extra configuration may be
      necessary. The INSTALL file for <code class="function">libreadline</code> says this:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 "Readline uses the termcap functions, but does not link with
 the termcap or curses library itself, allowing applications
 which link with readline the to choose an appropriate library."
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If your environment has not been set up so that an
      appropriate library is automatically included, you may need
      to add something like</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
LIBS="-ncurses"
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>immediately before the <code class="function">configure</code> command.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect17" name="pcre2build-3_sect17" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>DEBUGGING WITH VALGRIND SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>If you add</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-valgrind
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command,
      PCRE2 will use valgrind annotations to mark certain memory
      regions as unaddressable. This allows it to detect invalid
      memory accesses, and is mostly useful for debugging PCRE2
      itself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">

      <h2>CODE COVERAGE REPORTING</h2>

      <p>If your C compiler is gcc, you can build a version of
      PCRE2 that can generate a code coverage report for its test
      suite. To enable this, you must install <code class="function">lcov</code> version 1.6 or above. Then specify</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-coverage
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command and
      build PCRE2 in the usual way.</p>

      <p>Note that using <code class="function">ccache</code> (a
      caching C compiler) is incompatible with code coverage
      reporting. If you have configured <code class="function">ccache</code> to run automatically on your system,
      you must set the environment variable</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
CCACHE_DISABLE=1
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>before running <code class="function">make</code> to build
      PCRE2, so that <code class="function">ccache</code> is not
      used.</p>

      <p>When --enable-coverage is used, the following addition
      targets are added to the <code class="function">Makefile</code>:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
make coverage
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This creates a fresh coverage report for the PCRE2 test
      suite. It is equivalent to running "make coverage-reset",
      "make coverage-baseline", "make check", and then "make
      coverage-report".</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
make coverage-reset
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This zeroes the coverage counters, but does nothing
      else.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
make coverage-baseline
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This captures baseline coverage information.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
make coverage-report
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This creates the coverage report.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
make coverage-clean-report
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This removes the generated coverage report without
      cleaning the coverage data itself.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
make coverage-clean-data
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This removes the captured coverage data without removing
      the coverage files created at compile time (*.gcno).</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
make coverage-clean
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This cleans all coverage data including the generated
      coverage report. For more information about code coverage,
      see the <code class="function">gcov</code> and <code class="function">lcov</code> documentation.</p>
