      <h2>UNICODE AND UTF SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>When PCRE2 is built with Unicode support (which is the
      default), it has knowledge of Unicode character properties
      and can process text strings in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32
      format (depending on the code unit width). However, by
      default, PCRE2 assumes that one code unit is one character.
      To process a pattern as a UTF string, where a character may
      require more than one code unit, you must call <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2_compile()</span>(3)</span> with the
      PCRE2_UTF option flag, or the pattern must start with the
      sequence (*UTF). When either of these is the case, both the
      pattern and any subject strings that are matched against it
      are treated as UTF strings instead of strings of individual
      one-code-unit characters.</p>

      <p>If you do not need Unicode support you can build PCRE2
      without it, in which case the library will be smaller.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2unicode-3_sect2" name="pcre2unicode-3_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>When PCRE2 is built with Unicode support, the escape
      sequences \p{..}, \P{..}, and \X can be used. The Unicode
      properties that can be tested are limited to the general
      category properties such as Lu for an upper case letter or Nd
      for a decimal number, the Unicode script names such as Arabic
      or Han, and the derived properties Any and L&amp;. Full lists
      are given in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a> and
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2syntax.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2syntax</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation. Only the short names for properties are
      supported. For example, \p{L} matches a letter. Its Perl
      synonym, \p{Letter}, is not supported. Furthermore, in Perl,
      many properties may optionally be prefixed by "Is", for
      compatibility with Perl 5.6. PCRE does not support this.</p>
    </div>

      <a id="pcre2unicode-3_sect3" name="pcre2unicode-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>WIDE CHARACTERS AND UTF MODES</h2>

      <p>Codepoints less than 256 can be specified in patterns by
      either braced or unbraced hexadecimal escape sequences (for
      example, \x{b3} or \xb3). Larger values have to use braced
      sequences. Unbraced octal code points up to \777 are also
      recognized; larger ones can be coded using \o{...}.</p>

      <p>In UTF modes, repeat quantifiers apply to complete UTF
      characters, not to individual code units.</p>

      <p>In UTF modes, the dot metacharacter matches one UTF
      character instead of a single code unit.</p>

      <p>The escape sequence \C can be used to match a single code
      unit, in a UTF mode, but its use can lead to some strange
      effects because it breaks up multi-unit characters (see the
      description of \C in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation). The use of \C is not supported in the
      alternative matching function <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>(), nor is it supported in
      UTF mode by the JIT optimization. If JIT optimization is
      requested for a UTF pattern that contains \C, it will not
      succeed, and so the matching will be carried out by the
      normal interpretive function.</p>

      <p>The character escapes \b, \B, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and \W
      correctly test characters of any code value, but, by default,
      the characters that PCRE2 recognizes as digits, spaces, or
      word characters remain the same set as in non-UTF mode, all
      with code points less than 256. This remains true even when
      PCRE2 is built to include Unicode support, because to do
      otherwise would slow down matching in many common cases. Note
      that this also applies to \b and \B, because they are defined
      in terms of \w and \W. If you want to test for a wider sense
      of, say, "digit", you can use explicit Unicode property tests
      such as \p{Nd}. Alternatively, if you set the PCRE2_UCP
      option, the way that the character escapes work is changed so
      that Unicode properties are used to determine which
      characters match. There are more details in the section on
      generic character types in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation.</p>

      <p>Similarly, characters that match the POSIX named character
      classes are all low-valued characters, unless the PCRE2_UCP
      option is set.</p>

      <p>However, the special horizontal and vertical white space
      matching escapes (\h, \H, \v, and \V) do match all the
      appropriate Unicode characters, whether or not PCRE2_UCP is
      set.</p>

      <p>Case-insensitive matching in UTF mode makes use of Unicode
      properties. A few Unicode characters such as Greek sigma have
      more than two codepoints that are case-equivalent, and these
      are treated as such.</p>

      <h2>VALIDITY OF UTF STRINGS</h2>

      <p>When the PCRE2_UTF option is set, the strings passed as
      patterns and subjects are (by default) checked for validity
      on entry to the relevant functions. If an invalid UTF string
      is passed, an negative error code is returned. The code unit
      offset to the offending character can be extracted from the
      match data block by calling <code class="function">pcre2_get_startchar</code>(), which is used for
      this purpose after a UTF error.</p>

      <p>UTF-16 and UTF-32 strings can indicate their endianness by
      special code knows as a byte-order mark (BOM). The PCRE2
      functions do not handle this, expecting strings to be in host
      byte order.</p>

      <p>The entire string is checked before any other processing
      takes place. In addition to checking the format of the
      string, there is a check to ensure that all code points lie
      in the range U+0 to U+10FFFF, excluding the surrogate area.
      The so-called "non-character" code points are not excluded
      because Unicode corrigendum #9 makes it clear that they
      should not be.</p>

      <p>Characters in the "Surrogate Area" of Unicode are reserved
      for use by UTF-16, where they are used in pairs to encode
      code points with values greater than 0xFFFF. The code points
      that are encoded by UTF-16 pairs are available independently
      in the UTF-8 and UTF-32 encodings. (In other words, the whole
      surrogate thing is a fudge for UTF-16 which unfortunately
      messes up UTF-8 and UTF-32.)</p>

      <p>In some situations, you may already know that your strings
      are valid, and therefore want to skip these checks in order
      to improve performance, for example in the case of a long
      subject string that is being scanned repeatedly. If you set
      the PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK option at compile time or at match
      time, PCRE2 assumes that the pattern or subject it is given
      (respectively) contains only valid UTF code unit
      sequences.</p>

      <p>Passing PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() just disables the check for
      the pattern; it does not also apply to subject strings. If
      you want to disable the check for a subject string you must
      pass this option to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() or <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>().</p>

      <p>If you pass an invalid UTF string when PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK
      is set, the result is undefined and your program may crash or
      loop indefinitely.</p>

        defined by RFC 2279) allows for up to 6 bytes, and this is
