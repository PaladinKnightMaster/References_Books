      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p><span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> is
      a test program for the PCRE2 regular expression libraries,
      but it can also be used for experimenting with regular
      expressions. This document describes the features of the test
      program; for details of the regular expressions themselves,
      see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation. For details of the PCRE2 library function
      calls and their options, see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation.</p>

      <p>The input for <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> is a sequence of
      regular expression patterns and subject strings to be
      matched. The output shows the result of each match attempt.
      Modifiers on the command line, the patterns, and the subject
      lines specify PCRE2 function options, control how the subject
      is processed, and what output is produced.</p>

      <p>As the original fairly simple PCRE library evolved, it
      acquired many different features, and as a result, the
      original <span class="command"><strong>pcretest</strong></span> program ended up
      with a lot of options in a messy, arcane syntax, for testing
      all the features. The move to the new PCRE2 API provided an
      opportunity to re-implement the test program as <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span>, with a cleaner
      modifier syntax. Nevertheless, there are still many obscure
      modifiers, some of which are specifically designed for use in
      conjunction with the test script and data files that are
      distributed as part of PCRE2. All the modifiers are
      documented here, some without much justification, but many of
      them are unlikely to be of use except when testing the
      libraries.</p>

      <h2>PCRE2's 8-BIT, 16-BIT AND 32-BIT LIBRARIES</h2>

      <p>Different versions of the PCRE2 library can be built to
      support character strings that are encoded in 8-bit, 16-bit,
      or 32-bit code units. One, two, or all three of these
      libraries may be simultaneously installed. The <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> program can be
      used to test all the libraries. However, its own input and
      output are always in 8-bit format. When testing the 16-bit or
      32-bit libraries, patterns and subject strings are converted
      to 16- or 32-bit format before being passed to the library
      functions. Results are converted back to 8-bit code units for
      output.</p>

      <p>In the rest of this document, the names of library
      functions and structures are given in generic form, for
      example, <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>(). The
      actual names used in the libraries have a suffix _8, _16, or
      _32, as appropriate.</p>

      <h2>INPUT ENCODING</h2>

      <p>Input to <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> is processed line
      by line, either by calling the C library's <code class="function">fgets</code>() function, or via the <span class="command"><strong>libreadline</strong></span> library (see
      below). In Unix-like environments, <code class="function">fgets</code>() treats any bytes other than newline
      as data characters. However, in some Windows environments
      character 26 (hex 1A) causes an immediate end of file, and no
      further data is read. For maximum portability, therefore, it
      is safest to avoid non-printing characters in <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> input files.</p>

      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p>If <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span>
      is given two filename arguments, it reads from the first and
      writes to the second. If the first name is "-", input is
      taken from the standard input. If <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> is given only one
      argument, it reads from that file and writes to stdout.
      Otherwise, it reads from stdin and writes to stdout. When the
      input is a terminal, it prompts for each line of input, using
      "re&gt;" to prompt for regular expression patterns, and
      "data&gt;" to prompt for subject lines.</p>

      <p>When <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> is built, a
      configuration option can specify that it should be linked
      with the <span class="command"><strong>libreadline</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>libedit</strong></span> library. When this
      is done, if the input is from a terminal, it is read using
      the <code class="function">readline</code>() function. This
      provides line-editing and history facilities. The output from
      the <code class="option">−help</code> option states
      whether or not <code class="function">readline</code>() will
      be used.</p>

      <p>The program handles any number of tests, each of which
      consists of a set of input lines. Each set starts with a
      regular expression pattern, followed by any number of subject
      lines to be matched against that pattern. In between sets of
      test data, command lines that begin with a hash (#) character
      may appear. This file format, with some restrictions, can
      also be processed by the <em class="replaceable"><code>perltest.sh</code></em> script that is
      distributed with PCRE2 as a means of checking that the
      behaviour of PCRE2 and Perl is the same.</p>

      <p>Each subject line is matched separately and independently.
      If you want to do multi-line matches, you have to use the \n
      escape sequence (or \r or \r\n, etc., depending on the
      newline setting) in a single line of input to encode the
      newline sequences. There is no limit on the length of subject
      lines; the input buffer is automatically extended if it is
      too small. There is a replication feature that makes it
      possible to generate long subject lines without having to
      supply them explicitly.</p>

      <p>An empty line or the end of the file signals the end of
      the subject lines for a test, at which point a new pattern or
      command line is expected if there is still input to be
      read.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2test-1_sect6" name="pcre2test-1_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>COMMAND LINES</h2>

      <p>In between sets of test data, a line that begins with a
      hash (#) character is interpreted as a command line. If the
      first character is followed by white space or an exclamation
      mark, the line is treated as a comment, and ignored.
      Otherwise, the following commands are recognized:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
#forbid_utf
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Subsequent patterns automatically have the PCRE2_NEVER_UTF
      and PCRE2_NEVER_UCP options set, which locks out the use of
      UTF and Unicode property features. This is a trigger guard
      that is used in test files to ensure that UTF/Unicode tests
      are not accidentally added to files that are used when UTF
      support is not included in the library. This effect can also
      be obtained by the use of <span class="command"><strong>#pattern</strong></span>; the difference is
      that <span class="command"><strong>#forbid_utf</strong></span> cannot be
      unset, and the automatic options are not displayed in pattern
      information, to avoid cluttering up test output.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
#pattern &lt;modifier-list&gt;
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This command sets a default modifier list that applies to
      all subsequent patterns. Modifiers on a pattern can change
      these settings.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
#perltest
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The appearance of this line causes all subsequent modifier
      settings to be checked for compatibility with the <em class="replaceable"><code>perltest.sh</code></em> script, which is
      used to confirm that Perl gives the same results as PCRE2.
      Also, apart from comment lines, none of the other command
      lines are permitted, because they and many of the modifiers
      are specific to <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span>, and should not
      be used in test files that are also processed by <em class="replaceable"><code>perltest.sh</code></em>. The <span class="command"><strong>#perltest</strong></span> command helps
      detect tests that are accidentally put in the wrong file.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
#subject &lt;modifier-list&gt;
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This command sets a default modifier list that applies to
      all subsequent subject lines. Modifiers on a subject line can
      change these settings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2test-1_sect7" name="pcre2test-1_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>MODIFIER SYNTAX</h2>

      <p>Modifier lists are used with both pattern and subject
      lines. Items in a list are separated by commas and optional
      white space. Some modifiers may be given for both patterns
      and subject lines, whereas others are valid for one or the
      other only. Each modifier has a long name, for example
      "anchored", and some of them must be followed by an equals
      sign and a value, for example, "offset=12". Modifiers that do
      not take values may be preceded by a minus sign to turn off a
      previous setting.</p>

      <p>A few of the more common modifiers can also be specified
      as single letters, for example "i" for "caseless". In
      documentation, following the Perl convention, these are
      written with a slash ("the /i modifier") for clarity.
      Abbreviated modifiers must all be concatenated in the first
      item of a modifier list. If the first item is not recognized
      as a long modifier name, it is interpreted as a sequence of
      these abbreviations. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/abc/ig,newline=cr,jit=3
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This is a pattern line whose modifier list starts with two
      one-letter modifiers (/i and /g). The lower-case abbreviated
      modifiers are the same as used in Perl.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2test-1_sect8" name="pcre2test-1_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>PATTERN SYNTAX</h2>

      <p>A pattern line must start with one of the following
      characters (common symbols, excluding pattern
      meta-characters):</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/ ! " ' ` - = _ : ; , % &amp; @ ~
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This is interpreted as the pattern's delimiter. A regular
      expression may be continued over several input lines, in
      which case the newline characters are included within it. It
      is possible to include the delimiter within the pattern by
      escaping it with a backslash, for example</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/abc\/def/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If you do this, the escape and the delimiter form part of
      the pattern, but since the delimiters are all
      non-alphanumeric, this does not affect its interpretation. If
      the terminating delimiter is immediately followed by a
      backslash, for example,</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/abc/\
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>then a backslash is added to the end of the pattern. This
      is done to provide a way of testing the error condition that
      arises if a pattern finishes with a backslash, because</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/abc\/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>is interpreted as the first line of a pattern that starts
      with "abc/", causing pcre2test to read the next line as a
      continuation of the regular expression.</p>

      <p>A pattern can be followed by a modifier list (details
      below).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2test-1_sect9" name="pcre2test-1_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>SUBJECT LINE SYNTAX</h2>

      <p>Before each subject line is passed to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() or <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>(), leading and trailing
      white space is removed, and the line is scanned for backslash
      escapes. The following provide a means of encoding
      non-printing characters in a visible way:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \a         alarm (BEL, \x07)
 \b         backspace (\x08)
 \e         escape (\x27)
 \f         form feed (\x0c)
 \n         newline (\x0a)
 \r         carriage return (\x0d)
 \t         tab (\x09)
 \v         vertical tab (\x0b)
 \nnn       octal character (up to 3 octal digits); always
              a byte unless &gt; 255 in UTF-8 or 16-bit or 32-bit mode
 \o{dd...}  octal character (any number of octal digits}
 \xhh       hexadecimal byte (up to 2 hex digits)
 \x{hh...}  hexadecimal character (any number of hex digits)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The use of \x{hh...} is not dependent on the use of the
      <span class="command"><strong>utf</strong></span> modifier on
      the pattern. It is recognized always. There may be any number
      of hexadecimal digits inside the braces; invalid values
      provoke error messages.</p>

      <p>Note that \xhh specifies one byte rather than one
      character in UTF-8 mode; this makes it possible to construct
      invalid UTF-8 sequences for testing purposes. On the other
      hand, \x{hh} is interpreted as a UTF-8 character in UTF-8
      mode, generating more than one byte if the value is greater
      than 127. When testing the 8-bit library not in UTF-8 mode,
      \x{hh} generates one byte for values less than 256, and
      causes an error for greater values.</p>

      <p>In UTF-16 mode, all 4-digit \x{hhhh} values are accepted.
      This makes it possible to construct invalid UTF-16 sequences
      for testing purposes.</p>

      <p>In UTF-32 mode, all 4- to 8-digit \x{...} values are
      accepted. This makes it possible to construct invalid UTF-32
      sequences for testing purposes.</p>

      <p>There is a special backslash sequence that specifies
      replication of one or more characters:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\[&lt;characters&gt;]{&lt;count&gt;}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This makes it possible to test long strings without having
      to provide them as part of the file. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\[abc]{4}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>is converted to "abcabcabcabc". This feature does not
      support nesting. To include a closing square bracket in the
      characters, code it as \x5D.</p>

      <p>A backslash followed by an equals sign marks the end of
      the subject string and the start of a modifier list. For
      example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
abc\=notbol,notempty
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>A backslash followed by any other non-alphanumeric
      character just escapes that character. A backslash followed
      by anything else causes an error. However, if the very last
      character in the line is a backslash (and there is no
      modifier list), it is ignored. This gives a way of passing an
      empty line as data, since a real empty line terminates the
      data input.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>PATTERN MODIFIERS</h2>

      <p>There are three types of modifier that can appear in
      pattern lines, two of which may also be used in a
      <span class="command"><strong>#pattern</strong></span>
      command. A pattern's modifier list can add to or override
      default modifiers that were set by a previous <span class="command"><strong>#pattern</strong></span> command.</p>

        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect11" name="pcre2test-1_sect11" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Setting compilation options</h3>

        <p>The following modifiers set options for <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(). The most common ones
        have single-letter abbreviations. See <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreapi</span>(3)</span> for a description
        of their effects.</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
     allow_empty_class         set PCRE2_ALLOW_EMPTY_CLASS

</pre>
        </div>

        <p>As well as turning on the PCRE2_UTF option, the
        <span class="command"><strong>utf</strong></span> modifier
        causes all non-printing characters in output strings to be
        printed using the \x{hh...} notation. Otherwise, those less
        than 0x100 are output in hex without the curly
        brackets.</p>

        <h3>Setting compilation controls</h3>

        <p>The following modifiers affect the compilation process
        or request information about the pattern:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
     bsr=[anycrlf|unicode]     specify \R handling

     tables=[0|1|2]            select internal tables

        <p>The effects of these modifiers are described in the
        following sections.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect13" name="pcre2test-1_sect13" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Newline and \R handling</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>bsr</strong></span>
        modifier specifies what \R in a pattern should match. If it
        is set to "anycrlf", \R matches CR, LF, or CRLF only. If it
        is set to "unicode", \R matches any Unicode newline
        sequence. The default is specified when PCRE2 is built,
        with the default default being Unicode.</p>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>newline</strong></span> modifier
        specifies which characters are to be interpreted as
        newlines, both in the pattern and in subject lines. The
        type must be one of CR, LF, CRLF, ANYCRLF, or ANY (in upper
        or lower case).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect14" name="pcre2test-1_sect14" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Information about a pattern</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>debug</strong></span>
        modifier is a shorthand for <em class="replaceable"><code>info,fullbincode</code></em>,
        requesting all available information.</p>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>bincode</strong></span> modifier causes a
        representation of the compiled code to be output after
        compilation. This information does not contain length and
        offset values, which ensures that the same output is
        generated for different internal link sizes and different
        code unit widths. By using <span class="command"><strong>bincode</strong></span>, the same
        regression tests can be used in different environments.</p>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>fullbincode</strong></span> modifier, by
        contrast, <span class="command"><strong>does</strong></span> include length and
        offset values. This is used in a few special tests that run
        only for specific code unit widths and link sizes, and is
        also useful for one-off tests.</p>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>info</strong></span>
        modifier requests information about the compiled pattern
        (whether it is anchored, has a fixed first character, and
        so on). The information is obtained from the <code class="function">pcre2_pattern_info</code>() function. Here are
        some typical examples:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /(?i)(^a|^b)/m,info
 Capturing subpattern count = 1
 Compile options: multiline
 Overall options: caseless multiline
 First code unit at start or follows newline
 Subject length lower bound = 1
</pre>
        </div>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /(?i)abc/info
 Capturing subpattern count = 0
 Compile options: &lt;none&gt;
 Overall options: caseless
 First code unit = 'a' (caseless)
 Last code unit = 'c' (caseless)
 Subject length lower bound = 3
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>"Compile options" are those specified by modifiers;
        "overall options" have added options that are taken or
        deduced from the pattern. If both sets of options are the
        same, just a single "options" line is output; if there are
        no options, the line is omitted. "First code unit" is where
        any match must start; if there is more than one they are
        listed as "starting code units". "Last code unit" is the
        last literal code unit that must be present in any match.
        This is not necessarily the last character. These lines are
        omitted if no starting or ending code units are
        recorded.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect15" name="pcre2test-1_sect15" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Specifying a pattern in hex</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>hex</strong></span>
        modifier specifies that the characters of the pattern are
        to be interpreted as pairs of hexadecimal digits. White
        space is permitted between pairs. For example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/ab 32 59/hex
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This feature is provided as a way of creating patterns
        that contain binary zero and other non-printing characters.
        By default, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> passes patterns
        as zero-terminated strings to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(), giving the length as
        PCRE2_ZERO_TERMINATED. However, for patterns specified in
        hexadecimal, the actual length of the pattern is
        passed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect16" name="pcre2test-1_sect16" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>JIT compilation</h3>

        <p>The <code class="filename">/jit</code> modifier may
        optionally be followed by an equals sign and a number in
        the range 0 to 7:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 0  disable JIT
 1  use JIT for normal match only
 2  use JIT for soft partial match only
 3  use JIT for normal match and soft partial match
 4  use JIT for hard partial match only
 6  use JIT for soft and hard partial match
 7  all three modes
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If no number is given, 7 is assumed. If JIT compilation
        is successful, the compiled JIT code will automatically be
        used when <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is
        run for the appropriate type of match, except when
        incompatible run-time options are specified. For more
        details, see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2jit.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2jit</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation. See also the <span class="command"><strong>jitstack</strong></span> modifier below
        for a way of setting the size of the JIT stack.</p>

        <p>If the <span class="command"><strong>jitfast</strong></span> modifier is
        specified, matching is done using the JIT "fast path"
        interface, <code class="function">pcre2_jit_match</code>(),
        which skips some of the sanity checks that are done by
        <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), and of course
        does not work when JIT is not supported. If <span class="command"><strong>jitfast</strong></span> is specified
        without <span class="command"><strong>jit</strong></span>,
        jit=7 is assumed.</p>

        <p>If the <span class="command"><strong>jitverify</strong></span> modifier is
        specified, information about the compiled pattern shows
        whether JIT compilation was or was not successful. If
        <span class="command"><strong>jitverify</strong></span> is
        specified without <span class="command"><strong>jit</strong></span>, jit=7 is assumed. If
        JIT compilation is successful when <span class="command"><strong>jitverify</strong></span> is set, the
        text "(JIT)" is added to the first output line after a
        match or non match when JIT-compiled code was actually used
        in the match.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect17" name="pcre2test-1_sect17" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Setting a locale</h3>

        <p>The <code class="filename">/locale</code> modifier must
        specify the name of a locale, for example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/pattern/locale=fr_FR
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The given locale is set, <code class="function">pcre2_maketables</code>() is called to build a
        set of character tables for the locale, and this is then
        passed to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>()
        when compiling the regular expression. The same tables are
        used when matching the following subject lines. The
        <code class="filename">/locale</code> modifier applies only
        to the pattern on which it appears, but can be given in a
        <span class="command"><strong>#pattern</strong></span>
        command if a default is needed. Setting a locale and
        alternate character tables are mutually exclusive.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect18" name="pcre2test-1_sect18" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Showing pattern memory</h3>

        <p>The <code class="filename">/memory</code> modifier
        causes the size in bytes of the memory used to hold the
        compiled pattern to be output. This does not include the
        size of the <span class="command"><strong>pcre2_code</strong></span> block; it is
        just the actual compiled data. If the pattern is
        subsequently passed to the JIT compiler, the size of the
        JIT compiled code is also output. Here is an example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /a(b)c/jit,memory
 Memory allocation (code space): 21
 Memory allocation (JIT code): 1910
</pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect19" name="pcre2test-1_sect19" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Limiting nested parentheses</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>parens_nest_limit</strong></span>
        modifier sets a limit on the depth of nested parentheses in
        a pattern. Breaching the limit causes a compilation error.
        The default for the library is set when PCRE2 is built, but
        <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span>
        sets its own default of 220, which is required for running
        the standard test suite.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect20" name="pcre2test-1_sect20" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Using the POSIX wrapper API</h3>

        <p>The <code class="filename">/posix</code> modifier causes
        <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> to
        call PCRE2 via the POSIX wrapper API rather than its native
        API. This supports only the 8-bit library. When the POSIX
        API is being used, the following pattern modifiers set
        options for the <code class="function">regcomp</code>()
        function:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 caseless           REG_ICASE
 multiline          REG_NEWLINE
 no_auto_capture    REG_NOSUB
 dotall             REG_DOTALL     )
 ungreedy           REG_UNGREEDY   ) These options are not part of
 ucp                REG_UCP        )   the POSIX standard
 utf                REG_UTF8       )
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>aftertext</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>allaftertext</strong></span>

        <h3>Testing the stack guard feature</h3>

        <p>The <code class="filename">/stackguard</code> modifier
        is used to test the use of <code class="function">pcre2_set_compile_recursion_guard</code>(), a
        function that is provided to enable stack availability to
        be checked during compilation (see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a> documentation
        for details). If the number specified by the modifier is
        greater than zero, <code class="function">pcre2_set_compile_recursion_guard</code>() is
        called to set up callback from <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() to a local function. The
        argument it receives is the current nesting parenthesis
        depth; if this is greater than the value given by the
        modifier, non-zero is returned, causing the compilation to
        be aborted.</p>

        <h3>Using alternative character tables</h3>

        <p>The value specified for the <code class="filename">/tables</code> modifier must be one of the
        digits 0, 1, or 2. It causes a specific set of built-in
        character tables to be passed to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(). This is used in the
        PCRE2 tests to check behaviour with different character
        tables. The digit specifies the tables as follows:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 0   do not pass any special character tables
 1   the default ASCII tables, as distributed in

 2   a set of tables defining ISO 8859 characters
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>In table 2, some characters whose codes are greater than
        128 are identified as letters, digits, spaces, etc. Setting

        <h3>Showing more text</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>aftertext</strong></span> modifier
        requests that as well as outputting the part of the subject
        string that matched the entire pattern, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> should in
        addition output the remainder of the subject string. This
        is useful for tests where the subject contains multiple
        copies of the same substring. The <span class="command"><strong>allaftertext</strong></span> modifier
        requests the same action for captured substrings as well as
        the main matched substring. In each case the remainder is
        output on the following line with a plus character
        following the capture number.</p>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>allusedtext</strong></span> modifier
        requests that all the text that was consulted during a
        successful pattern match by the interpreter should be
        shown. This feature is not supported for JIT matching, and
        if requested with JIT it is ignored (with a warning
        message). Setting this modifier affects the output if there
        is a lookbehind at the start of a match, or a lookahead at
        the end, or if \K is used in the pattern. Characters that
        precede or follow the start and end of the actual match are
        indicated in the output by '&lt;' or '&gt;' characters
        underneath them. Here is an example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /(?&lt;=pqr)abc(?=xyz)/
 data&gt; 123pqrabcxyz456\=allusedtext
  0: pqrabcxyz
     &lt;&lt;&lt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This shows that the matched string is "abc", with the
        preceding and following strings "pqr" and "xyz" having been
        consulted during the match (when processing the
        assertions).</p>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>startchar</strong></span> modifier
        requests that the starting character for the match be
        indicated, if it is different to the start of the matched
        string. The only time when this occurs is when \K has been
        processed as part of the match. In this situation, the
        output for the matched string is displayed from the
        starting character instead of from the match point, with
        circumflex characters under the earlier characters. For
        example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /abc\Kxyz/
 data&gt; abcxyz\=startchar
  0: abcxyz
     ^^^
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Unlike <span class="command"><strong>allusedtext</strong></span>, the
        <span class="command"><strong>startchar</strong></span>
        modifier can be used with JIT. However, these two modifiers
        are mutually exclusive.</p>

        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect28" name="pcre2test-1_sect28" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Showing the value of all capture groups</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>allcaptures</strong></span> modifier
        requests that the values of all potential captured
        parentheses be output after a match. By default, only those
        up to the highest one actually used in the match are output
        (corresponding to the return code from <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>()). Groups that did not take
        part in the match are output as "&lt;unset&gt;".</p>
      </div>

        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect29" name="pcre2test-1_sect29" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Testing callouts</h3>

        <p>A callout function is supplied when <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> calls the
        library matching functions, unless <span class="command"><strong>callout_none</strong></span> is
        specified. If <span class="command"><strong>callout_capture</strong></span> is set,
        the current captured groups are output when a callout
        occurs.</p>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>callout_fail</strong></span> modifier can
        be given one or two numbers. If there is only one number, 1
        is returned instead of 0 when a callout of that number is
        reached. If two numbers are given, 1 is returned when
        callout &lt;n&gt; is reached for the &lt;m&gt;th time.</p>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>callout_data</strong></span> modifier can
        be given an unsigned or a negative number. Any value other
        than zero is used as a return from <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span>'s callout
        function.</p>
      </div>

        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect30" name="pcre2test-1_sect30" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Finding all matches in a string</h3>

        <p>Searching for all possible matches within a subject can
        be requested by the <span class="command"><strong>global</strong></span> or <code class="filename">/altglobal</code> modifier. After finding a
        match, the matching function is called again to search the
        remainder of the subject. The difference between
        <span class="command"><strong>global</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>altglobal</strong></span> is
        that the former uses the <span class="command"><strong>start_offset</strong></span> argument to
        <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() or <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() to start searching at a
        new point within the entire string (which is what Perl
        does), whereas the latter passes over a shortened subject.
        This makes a difference to the matching process if the
        pattern begins with a lookbehind assertion (including \b or
        \B).</p>

        <p>If an empty string is matched, the next match is done
        with the PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART and PCRE2_ANCHORED flags
        set, in order to search for another, non-empty, match at
        the same point in the subject. If this match fails, the
        start offset is advanced, and the normal match is retried.
        This imitates the way Perl handles such cases when using
        the <code class="filename">/g</code> modifier or the
        <code class="function">split</code>() function. Normally,
        the start offset is advanced by one character, but if the
        newline convention recognizes CRLF as a newline, and the
        current character is CR followed by LF, an advance of two
        characters occurs.</p>

        <h3>Testing substring extraction functions</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>copy</strong></span>
        and <span class="command"><strong>get</strong></span>
        modifiers can be used to test the <code class="function">pcre2_substring_copy_xxx</code>() and
        <code class="function">pcre2_substring_get_xxx</code>()
        functions. They can be given more than once, and each can
        specify a group name or number, for example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
abcd\=copy=1,copy=3,get=G1
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If the <span class="command"><strong>#subject</strong></span> command is used
        to set default copy and/or get lists, these can be unset by
        specifying a negative number to cancel all numbered groups
        and an empty name to cancel all named groups.</p>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>getall</strong></span>
        modifier tests <code class="function">pcre2_substring_list_get</code>(), which
        extracts all captured substrings.</p>

        <p>If the subject line is successfully matched, the
        substrings extracted by the convenience functions are
        output with C, G, or L after the string number instead of a
        colon. This is in addition to the normal full list. The
        string length (that is, the return from the extraction
        function) is given in parentheses after each substring,
        followed by the name when the extraction was by name.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect32" name="pcre2test-1_sect32" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Testing the substitution function</h3>

        <p>If the <span class="command"><strong>replace</strong></span> modifier is set,
        the <code class="function">pcre2_substitute</code>()
        function is called instead of one of the matching
        functions. Unlike subject strings, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> does not
        process replacement strings for escape sequences. In UTF
        mode, a replacement string is checked to see if it is a
        valid UTF-8 string. If so, it is correctly converted to a
        UTF string of the appropriate code unit width. If it is not
        a valid UTF-8 string, the individual code units are copied
        directly. This provides a means of passing an invalid UTF-8
        string for testing purposes.</p>

        <p>If the <span class="command"><strong>global</strong></span> modifier is set,
        PCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_GLOBAL is passed to <code class="function">pcre2_substitute</code>(). After a successful
        substitution, the modified string is output, preceded by
        the number of replacements. This may be zero if there were
        no matches. Here is a simple example of a substitution
        test:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 /abc/replace=xxx
     =abc=abc=
  1: =xxx=abc=
     =abc=abc=\=global
  2: =xxx=xxx=
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Subject and replacement strings should be kept
        relatively short for substitution tests, as fixed-size
        buffers are used. To make it easy to test for buffer
        overflow, if the replacement string starts with a number in
        square brackets, that number is passed to <code class="function">pcre2_substitute</code>() as the size of the
        output buffer, with the replacement string starting at the
        next character. Here is an example that tests the edge
        case:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 /abc/
     123abc123\=replace=[10]XYZ
  1: 123XYZ123
     123abc123\=replace=[9]XYZ
 Failed: error -47: no more memory
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>A replacement string is ignored with POSIX and DFA
        matching. Specifying partial matching provokes an error
        return ("bad option value") from <code class="function">pcre2_substitute</code>().</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Setting the JIT stack size</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>jitstack</strong></span> modifier
        provides a way of setting the maximum stack size that is
        used by the just-in-time optimization code. It is ignored
        if JIT optimization is not being used. The value is a
        number of kilobytes. Providing a stack that is larger than
        the default 32K is necessary only for very complicated
        patterns.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Setting match and recursion limits</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>match_limit</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>recursion_limit</strong></span> modifiers
        set the appropriate limits in the match context. These
        values are ignored when the <span class="command"><strong>find_limits</strong></span> modifier is
        specified.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2test-1_sect35" name="pcre2test-1_sect35" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Finding minimum limits</h3>

        <p>If the <span class="command"><strong>find_limits</strong></span> modifier is
        present, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> calls
        <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() several times,
        setting different values in the match context via
        <code class="function">pcre2_set_match_limit</code>() and
        <code class="function">pcre2_set_recursion_limit</code>()
        until it finds the minimum values for each parameter that
        allow <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() to
        complete without error.</p>

        <p>If JIT is being used, only the match limit is relevant.
        If DFA matching is being used, neither limit is relevant,
        and this modifier is ignored (with a warning message).</p>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>match_limit</strong></span> number is a
        measure of the amount of backtracking that takes place, and
        learning the minimum value can be instructive. For most
        simple matches, the number is quite small, but for patterns
        with very large numbers of matching possibilities, it can
        become large very quickly with increasing length of subject
        string. The <span class="command"><strong>match_limit_recursion</strong></span>
        number is a measure of how much stack (or, if PCRE2 is
        compiled with NO_RECURSE, how much heap) memory is needed
        to complete the match attempt.</p>

        <h3>Showing MARK names</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>mark</strong></span>
        modifier causes the names from backtracking control verbs
        that are returned from calls to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() to be displayed. If a mark
        is returned for a match, non-match, or partial match,
        <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span>
        shows it. For a match, it is on a line by itself, tagged
        with "MK:". Otherwise, it is added to the non-match
        message.</p>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>memory</strong></span>

        <h3>Setting a starting offset</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>offset</strong></span>
        modifier sets an offset in the subject string at which
        matching starts. Its value is a number of code units, not
        characters.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Setting the size of the output vector</h3>

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>ovector</strong></span> modifier applies
        only to the subject line in which it appears, though of
        course it can also be used to set a default in a
        <span class="command"><strong>#subject</strong></span>
        command. It specifies the number of pairs of offsets that
        are available for storing matching information. The default
        is 15.</p>

        <p>A value of zero is useful when testing the POSIX API
        because it causes <code class="function">regexec</code>()
        to be called with a NULL capture vector. When not testing
        the POSIX API, a value of zero is used to cause
        <code class="function">pcre2_match_data_create_from_pattern</code>()
        to be called, in order to create a match block of exactly
        the right size for the pattern. (It is not possible to
        create a match block with a zero-length ovector; there is
        always at least one pair of offsets.)</p>

        <h3>Passing the subject as zero-terminated</h3>

        <p>By default, the subject string is passed to a native API
        matching function with its correct length. In order to test
        the facility for passing a zero-terminated string, the
        <span class="command"><strong>zero_terminate</strong></span> modifier
        is provided. It causes the length to be passed as
        PCRE2_ZERO_TERMINATED. (When matching via the POSIX
        interface, this modifier has no effect, as there is no
        facility for passing a length.)</p>

        <p>When testing <code class="function">pcre2_substitute</code>(), this modifier also
        has the effect of passing the replacement string as
        zero-terminated.</p>

      <h2>THE ALTERNATIVE MATCHING FUNCTION</h2>

      <p>By default, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> uses the standard
      PCRE2 matching function, <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() to match each subject line.
      PCRE2 also supports an alternative matching function,
      <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>(), which
      operates in a different way, and has some restrictions. The
      differences between the two functions are described in the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2matching.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2matching</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation.</p>

      <p>If the <span class="command"><strong>dfa</strong></span>
      modifier is set, the alternative matching function is used.
      This function finds all possible matches at a given point in
      the subject. If, however, the <span class="command"><strong>dfa_shortest</strong></span> modifier is
      set, processing stops after the first match is found. This is
      always the shortest possible match.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2test-1_sect42" name="pcre2test-1_sect42" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>DEFAULT OUTPUT FROM pcre2test</h2>

      <p>This section describes the output when the normal matching
      function, <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), is
      being used.</p>

      <p>When a match succeeds, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> outputs the list
      of captured substrings, starting with number 0 for the string
      that matched the whole pattern. Otherwise, it outputs "No
      match" when the return is PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH, or "Partial
      match:" followed by the partially matching substring when the
      return is PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL. (Note that this is the entire
      substring that was inspected during the partial match; it may
      include characters before the actual match start if a
      lookbehind assertion, \K, \b, or \B was involved.)</p>

      <p>For any other return, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> outputs the PCRE2
      negative error number and a short descriptive phrase. If the
      error is a failed UTF string check, the code unit offset of
      the start of the failing character is also output. Here is an
      example of an interactive <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> run.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 $ pcre2test
 PCRE2 version 9.00 2014-05-10
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /^abc(\d+)/
 data&gt; abc123
  0: abc123
  1: 123
 data&gt; xyz
 No match
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Unset capturing substrings that are not followed by one
      that is set are not shown by <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> unless the
      <span class="command"><strong>allcaptures</strong></span>
      modifier is specified. In the following example, there are
      two capturing substrings, but when the first data line is
      matched, the second, unset substring is not shown. An
      "internal" unset substring is shown as "&lt;unset&gt;", as
      for the second data line.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /(a)|(b)/
 data&gt; a
  0: a
  1: a
 data&gt; b
  0: b
  1: &lt;unset&gt;
  2: b
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the strings contain any non-printing characters, they
      are output as \xhh escapes if the value is less than 256 and
      UTF mode is not set. Otherwise they are output as \x{hh...}
      escapes. See below for the definition of non-printing
      characters. If the <code class="filename">/aftertext</code>
      modifier is set, the output for substring 0 is followed by
      the the rest of the subject string, identified by "0+" like
      this:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /cat/aftertext
 data&gt; cataract
  0: cat
  0+ aract
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If global matching is requested, the results of successive
      matching attempts are output in sequence, like this:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /\Bi(\w\w)/g
 data&gt; Mississippi
  0: iss
  1: ss
  0: iss
  1: ss
  0: ipp
  1: pp
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>"No match" is output only if the first match attempt
      fails. Here is an example of a failure message (the offset 4
      that is specified by the <span class="command"><strong>offset</strong></span> modifier is past the
      end of the subject string):</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /xyz/
 data&gt; xyz\=offset=4
 Error -24 (bad offset value)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Note that whereas patterns can be continued over several
      lines (a plain "&gt;" prompt is used for continuations),
      subject lines may not. However newlines can be included in a
      subject by means of the \n escape (or \r, \r\n, etc.,
      depending on the newline sequence setting).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2test-1_sect43" name="pcre2test-1_sect43" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>OUTPUT FROM THE ALTERNATIVE MATCHING FUNCTION</h2>

      <p>When the alternative matching function, <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>(), is used, the output
      consists of a list of all the matches that start at the first
      point in the subject where there is at least one match. For
      example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /(tang|tangerine|tan)/
 data&gt; yellow tangerine\=dfa
  0: tangerine
  1: tang
  2: tan
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Using the normal matching function on this data finds only
      "tang". The longest matching string is always given first
      (and numbered zero). After a PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL return, the
      output is "Partial match:", followed by the partially
      matching substring. Note that this is the entire substring
      that was inspected during the partial match; it may include
      characters before the actual match start if a lookbehind
      assertion, \b, or \B was involved. (\K is not supported for
      DFA matching.)</p>

      <p>If global matching is requested, the search for further
      matches resumes at the end of the longest match. For
      example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /(tang|tangerine|tan)/g
 data&gt; yellow tangerine and tangy sultana\=dfa
  0: tangerine
  1: tang
  2: tan
  0: tang
  1: tan
  0: tan
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The alternative matching function does not support
      substring capture, so the modifiers that are concerned with
      captured substrings are not relevant.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2test-1_sect44" name="pcre2test-1_sect44" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>RESTARTING AFTER A PARTIAL MATCH</h2>

      <p>When the alternative matching function has given the
      PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL return, indicating that the subject
      partially matched the pattern, you can restart the match with
      additional subject data by means of the <span class="command"><strong>dfa_restart</strong></span> modifier. For
      example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
 data&gt; 23ja\=P,dfa
 Partial match: 23ja
 data&gt; n05\=dfa,dfa_restart
  0: n05
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>For further information about partial matching, see the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2partial.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2partial</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2test-1_sect45" name="pcre2test-1_sect45" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>CALLOUTS</h2>

      <p>If the pattern contains any callout requests, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span>'s callout
      function is called during matching. This works with both
      matching functions. By default, the called function displays
      the callout number, the start and current positions in the
      text at the callout time, and the next pattern item to be
      tested. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 ---&gt;pqrabcdef
   0    ^  ^     \d
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This output indicates that callout number 0 occurred for a
      match attempt starting at the fourth character of the subject
      string, when the pointer was at the seventh character, and
      when the next pattern item was \d. Just one circumflex is
      output if the start and current positions are the same.</p>

      <p>Callouts numbered 255 are assumed to be automatic
      callouts, inserted as a result of the <code class="filename">/auto_callout</code> pattern modifier. In this
      case, instead of showing the callout number, the offset in
      the pattern, preceded by a plus, is output. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /\d?[A-E]\*/auto_callout
 data&gt; E*
 ---&gt;E*
  +0 ^      \d?
  +3 ^      [A-E]
  +8 ^^     \*
 +10 ^ ^
  0: E*
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If a pattern contains (*MARK) items, an additional line is
      output whenever a change of latest mark is passed to the
      callout function. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /a(*MARK:X)bc/auto_callout
 data&gt; abc
 ---&gt;abc
  +0 ^       a
  +1 ^^      (*MARK:X)
 +10 ^^      b
 Latest Mark: X
 +11 ^ ^     c
 +12 ^  ^
  0: abc
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The mark changes between matching "a" and "b", but stays
      the same for the rest of the match, so nothing more is
      output. If, as a result of backtracking, the mark reverts to
      being unset, the text "&lt;unset&gt;" is output.</p>

      <p>The callout function in <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> returns zero
      (carry on matching) by default, but you can use a
      <span class="command"><strong>callout_fail</strong></span>
      modifier in a subject line (as described above) to change
      this and other parameters of the callout.</p>

      <p>Inserting callouts can be helpful when using <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> to check
      complicated regular expressions. For further information
      about callouts, see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2callout.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2callout</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>NON-PRINTING CHARACTERS</h2>

      <p>When <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> is outputting
      text in the compiled version of a pattern, bytes other than
      32-126 are always treated as non-printing characters and are
      therefore shown as hex escapes.</p>

      <p>When <span class="command"><strong>pcre2test</strong></span> is outputting
      text that is a matched part of a subject string, it behaves
      in the same way, unless a different locale has been set for
      the pattern (using the <code class="filename">/locale</code>
      modifier). In this case, the <code class="function">isprint</code>() function is used to distinguish
      printing and non-printing characters.</p>
